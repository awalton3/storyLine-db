# storyLine-db
#### The novel web app that blends creative writing with social media.

## Who are we?

Do you like reading or writing fiction but feel like you never have the time?

We are creating a web app where users can post single lines of their creation, from books, from movies, etc. and other users can write brief stories, 1000 words or less, that include that single line.

Our app will be a fun and inspiring way to read short pieces of writing and see different people's perspectives on the same initial starting point. Users can upvote stories or one liners they like, and follow writers they enjoy reading.

## Why should you use our app?

Maybe you like reading but are too busy to pick up that novel.

Maybe you like writing but don't know where to start.

storyLine is the place where you can take a break from your busy routine and let your imagination wander. Many existing writing sites focus on honing your individual craft.

But at storyLine, we believe that stories are meant to be shared. This is why we are committed to creating the first social media app that will connect people through the power of storytelling, a craft that should not be lost in the digital age, but amplified.

## Our Content Source
Our data will be sourced from real people. We have created a Google Form that contains several different one liners to inspire a short story. The form also collects participants' email addresses and desired usernames so that we can create their storyLine account. We also give contributors the option to have their story appear on our site anonymously. Additionally, we are collecting one liners through these form submissions, which we'll use to repopulate oneliner options periodically.

Here is the link to our Google Form:
